# Client-Side-Audio-Emotion-Detection---Phase-2
A **fully browser-based, real-time emotion detection system** built using **TensorFlow.js**, designed to run **entirely on the client side** with **no backend inference**.

This project represents **Phase-2++**, a stability-focused redesign after identifying deployment limitations in CNN-based browser models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build a **browser-deployable emotion detection system** that performs real-time inference on microphone audio using a **Dense-only neural network** and **MFCC features**, fully compatible with TensorFlow.js.

**Key Principle:**  
> If it doesn’t run safely in the browser, it doesn’t belong in Phase-2++.

## ✅ Key Features

- 🎧 Real-time microphone audio capture (Web Audio API)
- 🧠 Dense-only neural network (TFJS LayersModel)
- 📊 13-dimensional MFCC feature input
- ⚡ 100% client-side inference (no backend, no APIs)
- 🎨 Color-coded emotion confidence bars
- 🔁 Prediction smoothing (EMA)
- 🔇 Silence detection & gating
- ⏱ FPS / latency throttling for performance
- 🌐 Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## 🧠 Supported Emotions

The current model is trained to classify **4 emotions**:

| Emotion  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Angry   | High-energy negative affect |
| Happy   | Positive / excited affect |
| Sad     | Low-energy negative affect |
| Neutral | Baseline / calm speech |

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### ⚠️ Important
Do **NOT** open `index.html` directly using `file://`.  
TensorFlow.js requires an HTTP server.

---

### Option 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)

From the project root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
Then open in browser:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8000/public/index.html
Option 2: VS Code Live Server
Install Live Server extension

Right-click public/index.html

Select “Open with Live Server”

🧪 How to Use
Click Initialize

Allow microphone permission

Click Start Detection

Speak normally (try different emotions)

Observe:

Live emotion label

Confidence percentage

Color-coded bars

Silence is automatically detected and gated.

🧩 Technical Design (Phase-2++ Rules)
This phase intentionally avoids browser-unsafe designs.

✔ What’s Used
Dense neural network

Single-frame MFCC (no time stacking)

TensorFlow.js LayersModel

Web Audio API

❌ What’s Avoided
CNNs / spectrograms

RNNs / LSTMs

Backend inference

tfjs-node

SavedModel / GraphModel in browser

📊 Dataset & Training (Offline)
Dataset: CREMA-D

Feature: 13-dimensional MFCC

Training: Python (TensorFlow / Keras)

Export: Keras → TensorFlow.js LayersModel

Training scripts and raw datasets are intentionally excluded from this repo to keep it lightweight and deployment-focused.

⚠️ Known Limitations
Emotion accuracy depends on microphone quality

No temporal context (single-frame inference by design)

Model size and complexity intentionally limited for browser safety

These are acceptable tradeoffs for Phase-2++.

🔮 Future Roadmap
Phase-3: Hybrid CNN → Dense (distilled features, browser-safe)

Phase-4: Production hardening (WebWorkers, WASM, mobile optimization)

Emotion timeline visualization

Multi-language emotion labels

🏁 Phase Status
✅ Phase-2++ completed successfully
✅ Browser inference stable
✅ Architecture validated
